#Your First List
#Think of something you can store in a list. Make a list with
    #three or four items, and then print a message that includes at least one item from your list.
# Your sentence could be as simple as, "One item in my list is a __."


clouds = ['AWS','MS','GOOGLE','DIGITALOCEANS']
#message = 'One item in my list is a ' + clouds[-4]
print('One item in my list is a ' + clouds[-4])
